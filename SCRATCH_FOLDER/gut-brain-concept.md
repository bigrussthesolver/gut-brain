Ah, now I see where you're going - this is a fascinating reconceptualization of AI architecture. Let me think through this systematically:

1. Does this make sense?
The parallel is intriguing because the gut-brain system demonstrates several properties we might want in AI systems:

- Semi-autonomous subsystems that can operate independently while still maintaining coordination
- Multiple layers of decision-making and processing
- A complex feedback system that influences "higher-level" cognitive functions
- The ability to maintain homeostasis while adapting to environmental changes
- A secondary processing system that handles different types of "inputs" than the primary system

2. Framework Development Possibilities:

We could conceptualize an AI "gut" as:
- A secondary processing network that handles different types of data than the main "cognitive" network
- A system that maintains internal state and homeostasis
- A feedback mechanism that influences the main decision-making processes
- A semi-autonomous system that can make local decisions without consulting the main system

This could translate into:
- A dual-network architecture where one network handles immediate responses while another handles longer-term state management
- A system where certain types of decisions are delegated to subsystems that operate with relative autonomy
- Implementation of feedback loops between these systems that influence both immediate and long-term behavior

3. Testing Approaches:

To test this concept, you might:
- Create a simplified prototype with two interacting networks
- Compare performance between traditional single-network systems and dual-network systems
- Test the system's ability to maintain stability while adapting to new inputs
- Evaluate whether the system shows emergent properties not present in single-network architectures
- Measure the efficiency of decision-making when certain choices are delegated to the "gut" system

Would you like to explore any of these aspects in more detail? I'm particularly interested in how you envision the interaction between the "gut" and "brain" components in your system.
